// Exponentiation Operator
// The exponentiation operator ** is the equivalent of Math.pow(),
// but brought into the language instead of being a library function.

Math.pow(4, 2) == 4 ** 2
// This feature is a nice addition for math intensive JS applications.
// The ** operator is standardized across many languages including Python, Ruby, MATLAB, Lua, Perl and many others.
